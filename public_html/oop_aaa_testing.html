        <div class="article_content">
            <p>Code is an art form that allows for the communication between man and computer. As long as code follows
                the syntax of the language, the computer will read it and understand it properly. However, in the
                industrial world, the communication through code between individuals is also important. The way a code
                is written and how it is presented is vital to becoming a successful programmer. Within the tech industry,
                there are numerous reasons for an individual to write readable and clean code. There would be multiple
                people on a team working on the same code. There are people will need to pick up where you left off. You may
                even need to revisit the same code down the line. In essence, even if code works, it should be fit to a
                universal standard in order to allow for effective  communication between people.</p>
            <hr>
            <p> In Python, users typically follow the PEP8 style-guide, but this can differ from company to company.
                Pylint is a tool that aids in the unification of the python language and helps organize code in such a way
                that follows the style-guide, and also can detect errors, but also make suggestions to write better code.
                To begin the implementation, pylint first needs to be installed to the system, you can run the following
                command in terminal:
            </p>
            <p class="code_text">pip install pylint</p>
            <hr>
            <p>When implementing Pylint to your program, you will have a ".pylintrc" which is essentially the readme for
                Pylint. This document contains the style corrections Pylint will make along with how pylint will work and
                what will be returned after running pylint.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>To run pylint, it is very simple. Simply follow the format below, and it will return a report for your python file!</p>
            <p class="code_text">pylint your-python-file-here.py</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Here is an example of a pylint report. In the code below, we can see that I commented out the doctring of
            the function, which is not up to PEP8 standards. We can also see that there is a pylint comment under that which
            tells pylint not to report the following "errors".</p>
            <img class="article_img" src="images/pylint-error-code.png" alt="some code that will cause a pylint error">
            <p>And the report:</p>
            <img class="article_img" src="images/pylint-error-report.png" alt="pylint report for the code above">
            <p>As you can see, the report will locate exactly which line the error is on, and indicate why there is an issue.
                In this case, as stated above, there is a missing docstring. In conclusion, use pylint to keep your code
                clean, readable, and efficient!</p>
