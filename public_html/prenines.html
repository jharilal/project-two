        <h1 class="headline_text">Birth of the ARPAnet</h1>
        <p class="article_content">Inspired by the 1957 Soviet launch of the Sputnik into space, the United States government felt pressured to keep pace in technology. Eisenhower created ARPA, the Advanced Research Projects Agency in order to create a centralized group for research within the military branches. Utilizing the queueing theory of data transmission from Leornard Kleinrock and the development of packet switching networks from Paul Baran, in 1969, Bob Taylor initiated the ARPAnet project.</p>

        <h1 class="headline_text">Growth of the ARPAnet</h1>
        <p class="article_content">What initially was the connection between two timeshare computers at MIT, the ARPAnet steadily increased in size. Within the first year, the ARPAnet connected four computers, and three short years after, there were 25 different computers in the United States that were a part of the ARPAnet. Around 1971, Raymond Tomlinson had developed the email where one user was able to send a message to another user within the same network.</p>

        <h1 class="headline_text">TCP/IP</h1>
        <p class="article_content">Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP was developed in 1973 which allowed for communication of independent networks via highways. Initially, each network would have their own protocols and were not compatible with other networks, however, this development allowed for congruency between networks. Ten years after its establishment, TCP/IP became the universal standard for the internet. This was able to bring internet to the home and office. </p>
